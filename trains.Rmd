# The raw data does not have a column name for the first column, so, by default
# it gets X1. But this looks to be just a row number, so let's ignore. 

# The variable names in dat_all and dat_all_prime are just pathetic, as if they
# are the result of an extremely sloppy merge. What is the difference, for
# example, between party.x and party.y? The names in dat_t1 are fine.
