# The raw data does not have a column name for the first column, so, by default
# it gets X1. But this looks to be just a row number, so let's ignore. 

# The variable names in dat_all and dat_all_prime are just pathetic, as if they
# are the result of an extremely sloppy merge. What is the difference, for
# example, between party.x and party.y? The names in dat_t1 are fine.

dat.all <- read_csv("pnas_data.csv")

dat.t1  <- read_csv("t1_data.csv") # Only uses for some missing data tests?

dat.all.prime <- read_csv("prime_data.csv")

# Ignore the face data for now.

## Table 2

# I believe that this is the code which drives Table 2. I deleted the other
# tests. Note that income is present in the published table but at a different
# location than in the code. I could not get replicate the income numbers.
# Error?
